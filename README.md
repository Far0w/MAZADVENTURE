## How to install it ?

The game is not available on the Oculus Store, so you have to sideload it. 
First, you have to install [SideQuest](https://sidequestvr.com) on your computer.
Then you have two solutions :

1. First solution (the simplest one) : Add the repository of bzaalberg in the "My repos" section of Sidequest. The URL of the repo is : https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bartzaalberg/quest-repository/master/ , then search Mazadventure and install it!

2. Second solution : Go to the APKs section of this Git, then download the latest .apk file and grab it into SideQuest once your Oculus Quest is connected, it will install it.

Then go to under "Unknown sources" in your Quest's library and search for a game called Mazadventure.

Voil√†, it's done! Have fun :)
